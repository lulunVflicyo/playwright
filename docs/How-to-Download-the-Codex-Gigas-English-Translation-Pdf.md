## The History of the Codex Gigas
 
The Codex Gigas is believed to have been created in the early 13th century in the Benedictine monastery of PodlaÅ¾ice in Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic. The exact identity and motivation of the scribe who wrote the manuscript are unknown, but there are various legends and theories surrounding its origin.
 
One of the most popular legends is that the manuscript was written by a monk named Herman the Recluse, who had broken his monastic vows and was sentenced to be walled up alive. In order to avoid this fate, he promised to write a book that would contain all human knowledge in one night. He soon realized that this was impossible, so he prayed to the devil for help. The devil agreed to assist him in exchange for his soul and a portrait of himself in the book. The monk agreed and completed the manuscript with the devil's aid, but also included a confession of his sin and a plea for forgiveness at the end. This legend is based on a note written on a blank page of the manuscript by an unknown hand, which states: \"Hermanus inclusus\" (\"Herman the Recluse\"). [^1^]
 
Another legend is that the manuscript was written by a group of monks who wanted to create a masterpiece that would glorify their monastery and impress the king of Bohemia. They worked diligently for many years, copying various texts and adding beautiful illuminations. However, they also secretly included some heretical and occult writings that they had obtained from a mysterious stranger. When their abbot discovered their deception, he cursed them and their work, and ordered them to destroy the manuscript. But they refused and hid it in a secret chamber, where it remained until it was discovered by Swedish soldiers centuries later. This legend is based on some of the unusual contents of the manuscript, such as a magic formula for exorcism and a list of demons' names. [^2^]
 
A more plausible theory is that the manuscript was written by one or more scribes who were commissioned by a wealthy patron or an influential church official. The scribe or scribes may have been influenced by the intellectual and artistic trends of their time, such as scholasticism, humanism, and Gothic art. They may have also been inspired by other large manuscripts that were produced in Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, such as the Winchester Bible and the Floreffe Bible. The scribe or scribes may have used various sources for their texts, such as older manuscripts, printed books, oral traditions, and personal observations. The portrait of the devil may have been intended as a warning against sin or as a symbol of evil in contrast to God's goodness. [^3^]
 
The Codex Gigas remained in the monastery of PodlaÅ¾ice until 1420, when it was taken to Prague by King Wenceslaus IV during his wars against the Hussites. It was then transferred to several other locations over time, including Broumov Abbey, Sedlec Monastery, Cistercian Monastery in VyÅ¡Å¡Ã­ Brod, Prague Castle Library, and Clementinum Library. In 1648, during the Thirty Years' War, it was looted by Swedish troops under General KÃ¶nigsmarck and taken to Stockholm as part of their war booty. It was then placed in the Royal Library of Sweden (now National Library), where it remains today. [^4^]
