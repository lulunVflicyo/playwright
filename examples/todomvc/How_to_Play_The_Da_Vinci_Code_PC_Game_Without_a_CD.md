The game was released for Windows PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and received mixed reviews from critics and fans. One of the main complaints was the use of SecuROM v7, a copy protection system that required the original CD to be inserted in order to play the game. This caused problems for some players who had lost or damaged their CDs, or who wanted to play the game on multiple computers without swapping discs.
 
Fortunately, there are ways to play The Da Vinci Code PC game without a CD, by using cracks, patches or virtual drives. These methods allow you to bypass the SecuROM check and run the game from your hard drive or an image file. However, these methods may also have some drawbacks, such as compatibility issues, virus risks or legal implications. Therefore, you should use them at your own discretion and responsibility.
 
In this article, we will show you three possible ways to play The Da Vinci Code PC game without a CD:
 
1. Using a No-CD/Fixed EXE file
2. Using a No-DVD/Fixed Image file
3. Using a backup ISO file

## Using a No-CD/Fixed EXE file
 
A No-CD/Fixed EXE file is a modified version of the original executable file of the game that has been altered to remove or bypass the SecuROM check. This means that you can run the game without inserting the CD, as long as you have installed it on your computer.
 
To use a No-CD/Fixed EXE file, you need to download it from a reliable source, such as GameCopyWorld[^1^], MegaGames[^3^] or My Abandonware[^2^]. Make sure to choose the file that matches your game version and language. Then, you need to replace the original `\_BIN\SLAYER.EXE` file with the one from the downloaded archive. You may want to make a backup of the original file before doing this, in case something goes wrong.
 
After replacing the file, you can launch the game normally from your desktop shortcut or start menu. You should not need to insert the CD anymore.
 
## Using a No-DVD/Fixed Image file
 
A No-DVD/Fixed Image file is a modified version of the original image file of the game disc that has been altered to remove or bypass the SecuROM check. This means that you can mount the image file on a virtual drive and run the game from there, without inserting the CD.
 
To use a No-DVD/Fixed Image file, you need to download it from a reliable source, such as GameCopyWorld[^1^]. Make sure to choose the file that matches your game version and language. Then, you need to mount the image file on a virtual drive using a software like DAEMON Tools[^1^]. You may also need to use an anti-blacklisting tool, like SecuROM Loader v1.2[^1^], to avoid SecuROM v7 blacklisting of DAEMON Tools.
 
After mounting the image file on a virtual drive, you can launch the game normally from your desktop shortcut or start menu. You should not need to insert the CD anymore.
 
## Using a backup ISO file
 
A backup ISO file is an exact copy of the original disc of the game that has been created using a software like Alcohol 120% or CloneCD. This means that you can mount the ISO file on a virtual drive and run the game from there, as if you had inserted the CD.
 
To use a backup ISO file, you need to create it yourself from your own CD using one of the aforementioned software. Alternatively, you can download it from an online source, such as Archive.org[^5^], but this may be illegal in some countries. Then, you need to mount
